        <h2><a href="https://github.com/rushab-shah/research-insights-extractor">Research Insights Extractor</a></h2>
        <p>The <strong>Research Insights Extractor</strong> is an advanced system designed to automatically extract key features from medical literature, specifically from PDF files of research papers. This system utilizes the <strong>OpenAI GPT model</strong> to extract essential features such as the conclusion, number of subjects, relative risk, length of follow-up, among others. The extracted data is presented in a structured JSON format.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/rushab-shah/DistributedDatabaseSim">Replicated Concurrency Control and Recovery for a Simulated Distributed Database</a></h2>
        <p>This project simulated a distributed database system comprising 20 sites, incorporating multi-version concurrency control, deadlock detection, replication, and failure recovery using Python. The implementation achieved 99.99% data up-time and prevented 100% of transaction deadlocks across a range of simulated real-world scenarios.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/CSCI-GA-2820-SP23-003/recommendations">e-Commerce Product Recommendations</a></h2>
        <p>For this project, I spearheaded end-to-end development of a cloud-native microservice for product recommendations on an e-Commerce website. The project involved the implementation of 5 REST APIs using Python and Flask, following a test-driven development plan to reduce bugs in production. A CI/CD pipeline was configured using Github Actions for seamless updates to the cloud-native microservice. The microservice was containerized using Docker and deployed on IBM Cloud using Kubernetes.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/rushab-shah/DataVisualizationProject">Analyzing the correlation between co-morbidities and COVID-19 deaths</a></h2>
        <p>This project involved the analysis and visualization of the impact of 11 pre-existing condition groups on COVID-19 outcomes. It required the pre-processing of two datasets, containing 471K and 87.3 million rows, respectively using Python & Jupyter notebook. I leveraged 2 classification methods to identify correlations and 2 predictive models to generate predictions. The results were communicated through 10 visualizations created using Tableau to help identify the role co-morbidities played in case outcomes.</p>
